# Dynamic Semantics: From content to uptake

### Chris Barker, NYU Linguistics, chris.barker@nyu.edu

Utterances do things: they hire and inquire, they warn and they
inform.  And so dynamic theories of meaning model both the content and
some portion of the effect of an utterance.  This is a presumptuous
thing to do, since uptake depends on many factors, of which content is
just one.  Do we need dynamic theories just to compute content? (Yes!)
Should we even *try* to compute uptake? (Good luck...)

We'll begin with the classic dynamic semantics of the 80s and 90s,
working up to Groenendijk, Stokhof and Veltman's 95 Coreference and
Modality.  We'll follow with a more skeptical phase, considering a
rich body of work from Rutgers.  Finally, we'll consider Goodman and
Frank's Rational Speech Act framework, which provides tools for
reasoning about the relationship between content and uptake.

This course warmly welcomes philosophers and linguists from NYU, CUNY,
Rutgers, Columbia, and beyond.

There will be plenty of linguisticy empirical data detail, but we will
keep philosophical issues in view as we evaluate proposals.

Mode and coordinates: the seminar will be conducted remotely via Zoom.
The first meeting is on Wednesday 3 February 2021 from 15:30 till
17:35 New York time.  If you're interested, but you can't make the
first zoom meeting for some reason, please write to me at
chris.barker@nyu.edu.

Historical note: I last taught a seminar on dynamic semantics in 2008.
We'll be engaging with the work of several people who participated in
that earlier seminar.

### Related seminar, *highly recommended*: Mandelkern, Conditionals and epistemic modals, Thu 11-1.
Matt's slogan for the seminar: "there's something dynamic about language, 
but we can't account for that by folding those dynamics into the truth/update 
conditions of our connectives."  

## Tentative schedule (see bibliography below)

1. 3 Feb. Overview: sketch of how the seminar might go.  I'll present
   the simple system of Heim 1983, covering anaphora and
   presupposition projection.  Articulation of the major types of
   dynamical systems and their goals.  Major division: getting content
   right versus modeling uptake.

### Unit 1: Rewind

2. 10 Feb. Dynamic Predicate Logic.  1991.  Gronendijk and Stokhof.
   Truth conditions of donkey sentences as a dynamic setpiece.  Now
   update is primary, and truth is derived.  Predecessor and
   inspiration: Pratt's Dynamic Logic.  Important variants: Dekker's
   DPA, Musken's CDRT, van den Berg's Plural Information States, 
   de Groote's continuation-based Montagovian dynamics.

3. 17 Feb. Coreference and Modality.  1996. Gronendijk, Stokhof and
   Veltmann.  Dynamic anaphora meets epistemic update.  A high water
   mark in the old school style of dynamical systems.  Fascinating
   fragment that makes subtle predictions about how epistemic state
   influences truth.  I'll present a refactored fragment based on work
   of Jim Pryor.

### Unit 2: Fast Forward

4. 24 Feb. Anti-dynamics. 2007. Philippe Schlenker.  Argues that validating
   classical logic should be a design goal.  Case study: 
   accounting for presupposition projection in a
   static semantics.  Counterpoint: The view from sign language. 2011.
   ASL provides an argument in favor of doing donkeys dynamically.

5. 3 Mar. Discourse dynamics, pragmatics, and
   indefinites. 2012. Karen Lewis.  Even the ability of an indefinite
   to contribute a new discourse referent is negotiable.

6. 10 Mar. Varieties of update. 2014.  Sarah Murray. Some update is
   non-negotiable, including evidential inferences in Cheyenne.

7. 17 Mar. Appositive impositions in discourse.  2015. AnderBois,
   Brasoveanu, and Henderson. Appositives non-negotiably impose their
   content on the context state.  Getting at-issue content right
   depends on tracking appositive content.

8. 24 Mar.  Incremental quantification and the dynamics of pair-list
   phenomena.  2015. Dylan Bumford. A dynamic semantics helps
   compute the content of *Every year I buy a faster computer*.

9. 31 Mar. 
    
10. 7 Apr.

11. 14 Apr.  

### Unit 3: Radicalizing content

12. 21 Apr. Two papers in apposition (the second paper is 1 page long):
  * Semantics without semantic content.  2020.  Dan Harris.  "A sentence's semantic value is not its content but a partial and defeasible constraint on what it can be used to say."  
  * Predicting pragmatic reasoning in language games.  2012. Michael Frank and Noah Goodman.  A quantitative theory of how general cognition selects among possible contents.

13. 28 Apr.  Adjectival vagueness in a Baysian model of interpretation. 2017. How addressees select an extension for a vague adjective.
