A tremendously influential paper.  G&S simplify the study of dynamic semantics first by eliminating the natural 
language part---they only discuss logical formulas, and don't say exactly how to translate from a 
natural language into their logic---and second, by eliminating possible worlds (only assignment functions
remain).  A detailed treatment of donkey anaphora.
