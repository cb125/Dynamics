NYU semantics seminar announcement, spring 2021:

Dynamic Semantics 2: from content to uptake

Utterances do things: they hire and inquire, they warn and they
inform.  And so dynamic theories of meaning model both the content and
some portion of the effect of an utterance.  This is a presumptuous
thing to do, since uptake depends on many factors, of which content is
just one.  Do we need dynamic theories just to compute content? (Yes!)
Should we even *try* to compute uptake? (Good luck...)

We'll begin with the classic dynamic semantics of the 80s and 90s,
working up to Groenendijk, Stokhof and Veltman's 95 Coreference and
Modality.  We'll follow with a more skeptical phase, considering a
rich body of work from Rutgers.  Finally, we'll consider Goodman and
Frank's Rational Speech Act framework, which provides tools for
reasoning about the relationship between content and uptake.

This course warmly welcomes philosophers and linguists from NYU, CUNY,
Rutgers, Columbia, and beyond.

Mode and coordinates: the seminar will be conducted remotely via Zoom.
Depending on circumstances, there may also be an in-person contingent
that gathers in room 103 at 10 Washington Place on Wednesdays from
15:30 till 18:10 New York time starting on 3 February 2021.  If you're
interested, but you can't make the first zoom meeting for some reason,
please write to me at chris.barker@nyu.edu.

Historical note: I last taught a seminar on dynamic semantics in 2008.
We'll be engaging with the work of several people who participated in
that earlier seminar.
